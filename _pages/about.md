## About me
* Since the release of ChatGPT, I have started to pay attention to large language models and become very interested in them. During the summer vacation after graduation from college, I read papers related to Transformer, BERT, and GPT. In my first year of graduate studies, I took a course on pattern recognition, further understanding the related technologies. Currently, I am studying knowledge related to LLM reasoning and retrieval enhancement.
